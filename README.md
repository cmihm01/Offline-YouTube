# Offline-YouTube
## Description
Offline YouTube was a project for my Computing for Developing Regions class. With technological limitations
in mind, we designed a tool that allows teachers to browse for and download educational videos while they 
are connected to the internet, so that they can bring the videos back to classrooms that have no or low 
connectivity. This repository contains the beginning prototype. 
I worked in partnership with Mateo Davis and Owen Martin.
